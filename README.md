# EVLibrary
A Modelica library for modelling electric vehicles. The main objective of the library is to simulate the driving range of EVs using different strategies and configurations tested using the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). 

Some of the models, make use of some of the battery models from (https://github.com/modelica/ElectricalEnergyStorage). 

This library is still under development, so bugs are expected.
